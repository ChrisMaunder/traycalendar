Tray Calender is a 32-bit win95 freeware program that displays the day
of the month next to the clock in the system tray. It is not fancy, but
it does the job.

20 seconds after tray calender is started, it will reshuffle itself so
it is at the far right of the tray (ie. next to the clock).

Once a minute it will check the date to see if a new day has dawned, and
will change the displayed date accordingly.

These operations can be configured using the "Options..." option in
the popup menu.

I wrote Tray Calender becuase I needed a simple day-of-month indicator
on the tray bar without bells and whistles and nag screens. It is a 
simple idea, but for the life of me I cannot understand why other 
versions of this idea insisted on going overboard (or asking for money!)


Usage:
------

To run tray calender, simply double-click on the executable. Placing a
shortcut in the startup directory (c:\windows\startup) is not a bad idea.

To exit tray calender, right-click on the icon in the task bar and
select Exit.

To configure TrayCalender, rightclick on the icon in the system tray and 
select "Options...". At present there are 2 main options:

Auto-Shuffle - The time period (in seconds) between when application 
starts and when the system tray icon is shuffled to make it right most. 
This feature can be disabled by clicking in the "Disable" box to the 
left.

Check date -  The time interval (in minutes) between change-of-date
checks. This feature can be disabled by clicking in the "Disable" box 
to the left.

Known problems:
---------------

o None so far :)


New for version 1.21
--------------------

 o Minor tweaks. Nothing major.

New for version 1.2
-------------------

 o Finally got round to fixing the context menu bug.
 o Active "Mailto:" text in the "About" box, so as to make it easier
   for you all to email me to let me know that at least *someone* out
   there is using this thing.

New for version 1.1
-------------------

 o Configuration box attached to "Options..." item in popup menu.
